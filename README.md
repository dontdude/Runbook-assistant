# Runbook-assistant — AI Document Assistant

> Fork-inspired by [ahmeddyounis/corpus](https://github.com/ahmeddyounis/corpus) @ `65d4cc0` (MIT). Rebuilt and personalized by Chandan Mishra.

> **Chat with your documents.** A production-grade RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) service built with Spring Boot 4, Spring AI 2.0, and PostgreSQL/pgvector — exposing its knowledge both as a REST API and as an **MCP (Model Context Protocol) server** that Claude Desktop and other AI clients can call as a tool.

## What it does

Corpus lets a user upload documents (PDF, Markdown, DOCX, TXT), then ask questions about them in natural language and receive **streamed, citation-backed answers**. Under the hood it runs a full retrieval-augmented generation pipeline: documents are chunked and embedded, stored in PostgreSQL with pgvector, retrieved with **hybrid search** (keyword + vector, fused with Reciprocal Rank Fusion), and injected into an LLM prompt with source attribution.

Three things make it more than a tutorial RAG app:

1. **It is an MCP server.** Any MCP-compatible client (Claude Desktop, IDE agents, other LLM apps) can connect to Corpus over streamable HTTP and use `search_documents` / `ask_documents` / `list_documents` as native tools — turning your document store into part of the agentic AI ecosystem. Setup guide: [docs/mcp-setup.md](docs/mcp-setup.md).
2. **It measures itself.** A built-in evaluation harness scores retrieval quality (recall@k, MRR, nDCG) and answer faithfulness against a golden dataset, and fails CI if quality regresses. Every case runs with reranking off and on, so the improvement is a measured delta: on the distractor-hardened corpus, cross-encoder reranking takes **recall@1 from 0.688 to 0.813 and MRR from 0.792 to 0.883**. Token usage and estimated cost are tracked per request via Micrometer.
3. **It runs anywhere, keyless.** The `local` profile uses Ollama for chat and embeddings, so anyone can clone the repo and run the full stack with `docker compose up` — no API key required. The `cloud` profile switches to Anthropic or OpenAI with zero code changes. CI runs entirely keyless on an in-process ONNX embedding model and a deterministic stub chat model.

## Features

- **Document ingestion pipeline** — upload → parse (Apache Tika) → token-aware chunking with overlap → batch embedding → pgvector storage with HNSW index
- **Hybrid retrieval** — PostgreSQL full-text search (`tsvector`) + cosine similarity over embeddings, merged with Reciprocal Rank Fusion for better recall than either alone
- **Cross-encoder reranking** — an in-process ONNX `ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2` second stage scores each (query, passage) pair directly, the signal RRF structurally cannot see; keyless, fail-open, and A/B-able per request
- **Conversational RAG chat** — Spring AI `ChatClient` with a memory advisor, per-conversation JDBC-backed history, and **SSE token streaming** to the client
- **Inline citations** — every answer references the chunk IDs and source documents it drew from (`citations` SSE event; `[n]` markers in answers)
- **MCP server** — exposes `search_documents`, `ask_documents`, and `list_documents` tools over streamable HTTP at `/mcp`
- **Agentic tool calling** — the chat model can invoke an internal document-metadata tool (Spring AI function calling with user-scoped `ToolContext`)
- **Provider-agnostic models** — swap Anthropic ↔ OpenAI ↔ Ollama through configuration only
- **Embedding cache** — content-addressed, two-tier (in-process LRU + Postgres), keyed by `provider:model:dimension` so a model swap structurally cannot serve stale vectors
- **Semantic response cache** — per-user, pgvector-backed, invalidated by a corpus-version stamp; its similarity threshold is *measured* against 461 question pairs rather than guessed
- **Evaluation harness** — golden Q&A set, retrieval metrics (recall@5, MRR), LLM-as-judge faithfulness scoring, wired into CI
- **LLM observability** — Micrometer metrics for token usage, per-phase latency, and estimated cost per request; Prometheus endpoint; pre-built Grafana dashboard
- **Security** — stateless JWT auth (Spring Security), per-user document scoping enforced at the storage layer, request rate limiting (Bucket4j), and daily per-user token/cost quotas so a public demo cannot drain a budget
- **Production hygiene** — Testcontainers integration tests (95% line coverage on core packages, 80% gate), GitHub Actions CI, docker-compose one-command startup, virtual threads enabled

**Style: a modular monolith.** One deployable Spring Boot application with strict package boundaries (`ingestion`, `retrieval`, `chat`, `mcp`, `ops`, `security`). This is deliberate — see [ADR 0001](docs/decisions/0001-modular-monolith.md).

### Request flow (chat)

1. Client `POST /api/chat` with a question (JWT required).
2. The chat service calls the retrieval service with the user's query.
3. Retrieval runs **two searches in parallel** (virtual threads): full-text and vector similarity, both scoped to the user's documents.
4. Results are fused with Reciprocal Rank Fusion; top-k chunks are selected.
5. Numbered context chunks + citation instructions are injected into the prompt; conversation memory is appended by the memory advisor.
6. The model's response **streams back over SSE** (`token` events), followed by `citations`, `usage` (tokens, estimated cost, phase latencies), and `done` events.
7. Metrics are recorded (tokens in/out, per-phase latency, estimated cost, retrieval scores).

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

- Docker + Docker Compose
- (Optional, `cloud` profile) an Anthropic or OpenAI API key

### Run fully local — no API key

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dontdude/Runbook-assistant && cd Runbook-assistant
docker compose up --build
```

- App: http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html · Metrics: http://localhost:8080/actuator/prometheus
- Postgres is published on host port **5433** (to avoid clashing with a local Postgres).
- First run pulls the Ollama chat + embedding models (**several GB**) via the one-shot `ollama-init` service; later starts are fast.
- The demo user (`demo`/`demo`) is seeded along with eight sample documents about the system itself — ask it questions about HNSW tuning, chunking, or JWTs.

Add Prometheus + Grafana (provisioned dashboard at http://localhost:3000):

```bash
docker compose --profile monitoring up -d
```

### Run against a cloud model

```bash
docker compose up -d postgres
export SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE=cloud
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...   # or OPENAI_API_KEY + CORPUS_CHAT_PROVIDER=openai
./gradlew bootRun
```

Cloud chat defaults to Anthropic (`claude-sonnet-4-5`); embeddings default to the **in-process ONNX model** so no second API key is needed. Opt into OpenAI embeddings with `CORPUS_EMBEDDING_PROVIDER=openai CORPUS_EMBEDDING_DIMENSION=1536` (requires a wipe — see below).

### Try it

```bash
TOKEN=$(curl -s -X POST localhost:8080/api/auth/token \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"username":"demo","password":"demo"}' | jq -r .token)

curl -X POST localhost:8080/api/documents \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" -F file=@mydoc.pdf

curl -N -X POST localhost:8080/api/chat \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -H 'Accept: text/event-stream' \
  -d '{"message":"Summarize the termination clause and cite the source."}'
```

### Web UI (React)

Minimal chat + upload + cited-search UI in `web/` (Vite + React 18 + TS, no extra deps).
The backend proxies `/api` to `localhost:8080`, so start the stack above first:

```bash
cd web && npm install && npm run dev   # http://localhost:5173, login demo/demo
```

Tabs: **chat** (SSE streaming, `[n]` citations, token/cost usage), **docs**
(upload with ingestion polling), **search** (hybrid retrieval with per-request
`rerank` A/B toggle and score breakdown). In the `keyless` profile chat
returns the documented 503, shown in the trace drawer.

## Configuration

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE` | `local` | `local` (Ollama) · `cloud` (Anthropic/OpenAI) · `keyless` (no chat; ingestion+search only) |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` / `OPENAI_API_KEY` | — | Cloud provider credentials (`cloud` profile) |
| `CORPUS_CHAT_PROVIDER` | `anthropic` | Cloud chat provider: `anthropic` or `openai` |
| `CORPUS_CHAT_MODEL` | profile-dependent | Chat model id (`qwen3:4b` local, `claude-sonnet-4-5` cloud) |
| `CORPUS_EMBEDDING_PROVIDER` | `transformers` (cloud) | `transformers` (in-process ONNX) or `openai` |
| `CORPUS_EMBEDDING_MODEL` | profile-dependent | Embedding model id (`nomic-embed-text` local) |
| `CORPUS_EMBEDDING_DIMENSION` | profile-dependent | Must match the model — see matrix below |
| `CORPUS_CHUNK_SIZE` / `CORPUS_CHUNK_OVERLAP` | `512` / `64` (tokens) | Chunking strategy (cl100k_base) |
| `CORPUS_RETRIEVAL_TOP_K` | `6` | Chunks injected into the prompt |
| `CORPUS_RRF_K` | `60` | Reciprocal Rank Fusion constant |
| `CORPUS_JWT_SECRET` | dev value | HMAC secret for JWT (≥32 bytes; override outside dev) |
| `CORPUS_RATE_LIMIT_RPM` | `30` | Per-user requests/minute |
| `CORPUS_TOKEN_RATE_LIMIT_RPM` | `10` | Per-IP attempts/minute on `/api/auth/token` |
| `CORPUS_RATE_LIMIT_BACKEND` | `memory` (deployed: `postgres`) | `postgres` shares budgets across replicas |
| `CORPUS_MAX_TOP_K` | `20` | Hard ceiling on retrieved chunks (covers MCP tool calls) |
| `CORPUS_RERANK_ENABLED` | `true` | Second-stage cross-encoder reranking; `/api/search`'s `rerank` flag overrides per request |
| `CORPUS_RERANK_CONCURRENCY` | `2` | Concurrent rerank inferences; also sets ONNX intra-op threads (`cores / concurrency`) |
| `CORPUS_EMBEDDING_CACHE_ENABLED` | `true` | Content-addressed embedding cache (in-process + Postgres) |
| `CORPUS_EMBEDDING_CACHE_L1` / `_L2` | `10000` / `100000` | Cache entries per replica / per namespace in Postgres |
| `CORPUS_RESPONSE_CACHE_ENABLED` | `true` | Per-user semantic answer cache |
| `CORPUS_RESPONSE_CACHE_THRESHOLD` | `0.72` | Cosine similarity for "same question" — measured, see ADR 0012 |
| `CORPUS_QUOTA_ENABLED` | `true` | Enforce daily token/cost ceilings (kill switch) |
| `CORPUS_DAILY_TOKENS` / `_COST_USD` | `1000000` / `5.0` | Per-user daily budget; `user_quotas` overrides per user |
| `CORPUS_DB_POOL_SIZE` | `10` | Hikari max pool size; `replicas x this` must fit the DB connection cap |
| `CORPUS_INGESTION_CONCURRENCY` | `4` | Concurrent ingestions before load shedding (503) |
| `CORPUS_RESILIENCE_ENABLED` | `true` | Circuit breakers around chat/embedding calls |

### Embedding dimension matrix

The embedding dimension is baked into the `vector_store` schema. **Switching embedding models requires a wipe + re-ingest:** `docker compose down -v && docker compose up`. A startup guard refuses to boot on a mismatch and tells you exactly that.

| Profile | Embedding model | Dimension |
|---|---|---|
| `test` / CI / `keyless` | ONNX all-MiniLM-L6-v2 (in-process) | 384 |
| `local` | `nomic-embed-text` (Ollama) | 768 |
| `cloud` (default) | ONNX all-MiniLM-L6-v2 (in-process) | 384 |
| `cloud` + OpenAI embeddings | `text-embedding-3-small` | 1536 |

## Evaluation harness

Quality is a feature. Corpus ships with [`evals/golden-set.yaml`](evals/golden-set.yaml) — 32 question → expected-source → reference-answer cases over the seeded sample documents. Six of the 14 documents are deliberate **distractors** that share vocabulary with a real source but answer a different question, and the 14 cases tagged `hard` are the ones whose keywords appear in both. Without them the metrics saturate at 1.000 and no ranking change can be measured.

Every case runs **twice, with reranking off and on**, so the cross-encoder's effect is a measured delta in the build output rather than a claim:

| Metric | What it measures | Gate | RRF only | + rerank | Δ |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `recall@1` | Correct source ranked first | — | 0.688 | **0.813** | +0.125 |
| `recall@3` | Correct source in the top 3 | ≥ 0.82 | 0.875 | **0.938** | +0.063 |
| `recall@5` | Correct source in the top 5 | ≥ 0.88 | 0.938 | **0.969** | +0.031 |
| `MRR` | How high the correct source ranks | ≥ 0.74 | 0.792 | **0.883** | +0.091 |
| `nDCG@5` | Ordering quality within the window | ≥ 0.76 | 0.814 | **0.879** | +0.065 |
| Faithfulness (LLM-as-judge) | Is the answer grounded in retrieved context? | ≥ 0.80 | nightly | | |
| Answer relevance (LLM-as-judge) | Does the answer address the question? | ≥ 0.80 | nightly | | |

On the 14 `hard` cases the gap is wider still — recall@1 0.643 → 0.786, recall@3 0.929 → **1.000** — which is what you would expect if the distractors are doing their job. The cost is **+231 ms per query** (3.8 ms → 235 ms on 14 cores), paid on a path whose downstream LLM call takes seconds; `CORPUS_RERANK_ENABLED=false` turns it off. [ADR 0010](docs/decisions/0010-cross-encoder-reranking.md) records the tuning runs, including two settings that looked like free wins and were not.

Gates are set to a measured value minus a 0.05 margin, never aspirationally, and reranking additionally has to beat the fusion-only head on the *same run* — an absolute gate alone would let a reranker that quietly made ordering worse still pass, since those gates were set from the fusion-only baseline.

- **Retrieval metrics run on every PR** (`./gradlew test`) using the in-process ONNX models — deterministic and keyless, with a per-case report and rank-movement table in the test output.
- **Judge-based metrics run nightly** (`./gradlew nightlyEval` with `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`; the scheduled workflow publishes the JSON report to the run summary and fails on threshold breach).

This turns "the bot seems fine" into a tracked, enforced quality bar — and gives you before/after numbers when you tune chunking, k, or prompts. Methodology: [ADR 0007](docs/decisions/0007-keyless-ci-and-evals.md).

---

## Observability

- **Token & cost tracking** — per-request usage from Spring AI metadata → `corpus_llm_tokens_total{direction,model,provider}` and `corpus_llm_cost_estimate_usd_total` via a configurable price table (`corpus.pricing.models.*`).
- **Latency** — `corpus_rag_phase_seconds` histogram timers per phase: `embedding`, `retrieval`, `first_token`, `full_response`.
- **Retrieval quality signals** — `corpus_retrieval_top_score` and `corpus_retrieval_score_spread` gauges to spot degraded retrieval in production.
- **Rerank health** — `corpus_retrieval_rerank_seconds` (tagged by `reranker`) and `corpus_rerank_failures_total{reason}`; a rising `reason="shed"` or `"timeout"` means reranking is silently degrading to fusion order under load.
- **Cache effectiveness** — `corpus_embedding_cache_total{result,tier}` and `corpus_response_cache_total{result}` give hit ratios per tier, so the saving is measured rather than assumed; a cache hit reports zero tokens and zero cost, because none were spent.
- **Ingestion backlog** — `corpus_ingestion_pending_documents`, the production check that the stale-ingestion sweeper is actually reclaiming stranded documents.
- Exposed via `/actuator/prometheus`; `docker compose --profile monitoring up` adds Prometheus + a provisioned Grafana dashboard ([docs/grafana-dashboard.json](docs/grafana-dashboard.json)).
- Live capture ([docs/observability.png](docs/observability.png)): HTTP rate + 429 gauge populated from real traffic; token/cost panels fill in once a chat model is configured (`local`/`cloud`) — keyless serves retrieval metrics only, by design.
- **SLOs and alerting** — four objectives in [docs/slo.md](docs/slo.md), multi-window multi-burn-rate error-budget alerts in [alerts.yml](deploy/helm/corpus/files/alerts.yml) (one canonical file consumed by both compose and the Helm chart, validated by `promtool check rules` in CI), and a [runbook](docs/runbook.md) section per alert reachable from its `runbook_url`.

## Testing strategy

| Level | Scope | Tooling |
|---|---|---|
| Unit | Chunker windows/overlap, RRF fusion, bucket semantics | JUnit 5 |
| Integration | Ingestion → retrieval → chat round-trips against **real Postgres+pgvector** | Testcontainers, ONNX embeddings, stub chat model |
| Contract | REST + SSE event framing, MCP JSON-RPC handshake + tool calls, per-user scoping | Raw JDK HttpClient assertions |
| Eval (PR) | recall@k, MRR, nDCG@5 on the golden set, with and without reranking | Deterministic, keyless |
| Eval (nightly) | Faithfulness & relevance, judge-scored | Real model via secret |

Coverage gate via JaCoCo: ≥ 80% line coverage on `ingestion`/`retrieval`/`chat`/`security` (currently ~95%).

---

## CI/CD

- **`ci.yml`** — on PR/push: build, unit + integration + PR-tier evals (Testcontainers + cached ONNX model), JaCoCo gate, Docker image build.
- **`eval-nightly.yml`** — scheduled: judge evals against a live model (repo secret `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`), report posted to the run summary; fails loudly on threshold breach.
- Dependabot for Gradle, Actions, and Docker bumps (Spring AI moves fast — this stays visible).

## Design decisions & trade-offs

Full ADRs in [docs/decisions/](docs/decisions/); summaries:

1. **[PostgreSQL + pgvector over a dedicated vector DB](docs/decisions/0002-postgres-pgvector-single-store.md).** One datastore, transactional consistency, honest capacity for this scale; the vector store sits behind Spring AI's abstraction so migration is contained.
2. **[Hybrid search with RRF over vector-only](docs/decisions/0003-hybrid-retrieval-rrf.md).** Vector search misses exact identifiers; keyword search misses paraphrases. RRF is parameter-light and measurably better on the golden set.
3. **[Modular monolith over microservices](docs/decisions/0001-modular-monolith.md).** One deployable, reviewable in a sitting, with explicit seams where services would split.
4. **MCP server instead of API-only.** REST serves humans; MCP makes Corpus consumable by AI agents with the same identity model ([ADR 0006](docs/decisions/0006-jwt-and-mcp-access.md)).
5. **Provider abstraction with a local-first default.** Ollama default = zero-cost onboarding and no secrets in CI; cloud profile = production realism; cost is a first-class metric.
6. **[Evals in CI](docs/decisions/0007-keyless-ci-and-evals.md).** LLM apps regress silently; automated retrieval/faithfulness gates make quality a build artifact instead of a vibe.
7. **[Virtual threads over reactive](docs/decisions/0005-sse-on-virtual-threads.md).** RAG is I/O-bound fan-out; virtual threads keep the concurrency win with a blocking, debuggable programming model.
8. **[Fork operating model](docs/decisions/0014-fork-operating-model.md).** Keyless daily driver via gitignored `.env` (no Ollama RAM), separate Vite UI, history preserved with cosmetic-only rebrand.
